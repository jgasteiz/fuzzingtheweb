#Fuzzopress

Fuzzopress is a simple blogging app developed with Django.

After installing the requirements (Gunicorn is not really a requirement to run it) and initializing a database, you should be able to start blogging

Note: I've incluede an Analytics script tag in base.html, to track my blog (actually I'm using Fuzzopress for my own blog), so maybe you'll need to delete this few lines of code to use it.
