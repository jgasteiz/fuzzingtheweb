#Fuzzopress

Fuzzopress is a simple blogging app developed with Django.

After installing the requirements (Gunicorn is not really a requirement to run it) and initializing a database, you should be able to start blogging.

I do actually use it for my own blog! [Fuzzing the Web](http://fuzzingtheweb.com "fuzzingtheweb")
Disclaimer: most of it is in spanish

###You can add Navbar items easily (from the admin, title + url)
